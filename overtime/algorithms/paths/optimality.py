def calculate_fastest_path_durations(graph, root, interval=None):
    """
        Returns a dictionary where the keys are node labels and the values are the duration of the fastest path- i.e.
        the path which minimizes elapsed time- to all other nodes from a given root. Unreachable nodes have fastest path
        duration set to infinity.

        Parameter(s):
        -------------
        graph : TemporalDiGraph
            A directed temporal graph.
        root: string
            The node label for a node to use as root.
        interval : tuple/List
            A time interval.
            For example: ((0,3))

        Returns:
        --------
        fastest_path_durations : dict
            The durations of the fastest paths to all other nodes from the root node.
            For example: {A: 0, B: 2, C: 4, D: inf...}

        Notes:
        ------
        Our implementation for calculating fastest temporal path durations is based on the algorithm as specified in
        "Path Problems in Temporal Graphs" (Wu et al. 2014), found here: https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol7/p721-wu.pdf.
        Their algorithm takes as input a temporal graph (rather than, say, a static expansion) and returns the duration
        of the fastest time-respecting paths to all other nodes.

        TODO
        ----
        - Generalize to undirected graphs
        - Perhaps have this function return the actual tree, and another function to calculate the duration of paths
          in that tree
